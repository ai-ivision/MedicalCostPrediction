# Problem Statement: Medical Cost Prediction

## Background
The rising costs of healthcare have become a significant concern for individuals, insurance companies, and policymakers. Understanding the factors that influence medical costs is crucial for developing strategies to manage and predict expenses effectively. The given dataset provides detailed information on medical costs for individuals over a decade, including various demographic and lifestyle attributes.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates annual medical costs for individuals based on their demographic and lifestyle characteristics. By leveraging this model, stakeholders can gain insights into the key factors driving medical expenses, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation.

## Data Description
The dataset contains 10,000 records of medical costs for individuals from 2010 to 2020, with the following attributes:
- **Age:** The age of the individual (ranging from 18 to 65 years).
- **Sex:** Gender of the individual (male or female).
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index of the individual, indicating the level of obesity (ranging from 15 to 40).
- **Children:** Number of children covered by health insurance (ranging from 0 to 5).
- **Smoker:** Smoking status of the individual (yes or no).
- **Region:** Residential area in the US (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
- **Medical Cost:** Annual medical costs incurred by the individual (in USD).

## Scope
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the distribution of medical costs and other attributes.
   - Identify correlations between features and the target variable (medical cost).
   - Visualize data to uncover patterns and trends.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize/standardize numerical features.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Develop regression models to predict medical costs, including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regression
     - Random Forest Regression
     - Gradient Boosting Regression
     - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
     - Neural Networks

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
   - Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.

5. **Model Interpretation and Insights:**
   - Interpret the coefficients of the regression model to understand the impact of each feature on medical costs.
   - Identify key factors driving medical expenses and provide actionable insights.

6. **Visualization and Reporting:**
   - Create visualizations to illustrate model performance and findings.
   - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, model development, and key insights.


## Impact
Accurate prediction of medical costs can help individuals plan their finances better, assist insurance companies in designing fair premium structures, and support policymakers in developing effective healthcare strategies. This project aims to provide a robust foundation for understanding and predicting medical expenses, contributing to better healthcare management and cost control.

### Conclusion
Based on the results, the **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and **XGBRegressor** are the most promising models for predicting medical costs with high accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning further enhanced the performance of **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBRegressor**, making them top candidates for this task. Further tuning and validation can be done on these models to ensure their robustness and generalization to new data.
